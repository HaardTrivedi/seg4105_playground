# Lab 3
1. Shape up gives a structured process to users that keeps them on task so features are sure to be implemented within each cycle.

2. Sometimes 6 weeks is not enough time or too much time fora feature and adjusting the scope is just not ideal or realistic. In that case being able to adjust the timeline of a cycle from 6 to maybe 4 or 8 weeks would be beneficial.

3. What is the alternative if 6 weeks is not the best cycle time and the scope is not adjustable.
